# Prework - *Name of App Here*

Submitted by: Yih Der Liou

Prework IOS101 is an app that... has three labels that include my name, the university that I attend, and my current job position. Also includes a button that changes the background color of the app.

Time spent: 1 hour spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color
 

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Instagram
- Allows users to upload pictures and videos
- Share content via the messaging feature

iMessage
- Interesting in-app animations when sending messages
- Allow users to access Facetime with a click of a button

Apple Maps
- Can enter a destination and show me the quickest path to get there
- Different views of the map

I would like to build an app to collaborate with major movie theatre brands to access the newest movies. Users can purchase movies from their phones instead of going to the movie theatre.
